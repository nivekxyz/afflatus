Changelog
------------
0.1 - Initial commit

0.2 - Removed transparency from shell theme. This results in the panel and menus better matching the window headers and improves readability in the menus.

0.3 - Added borders to shell menus so that they don't blend into gtk+ elements like headerbars. This made the theme look much nicer with the default Gnome-Shell desktop setup.

0.4 - Fixed issue with shell theme that resulted in the default panel.solid color (black) taking over the panel when a window was full screen or near the panel. 

3.26 - Changed versioning to match Gnome releases and made some refinements to the Gnome-Shell theme.

3.26.1 - Rebased GTK theme on current clone of Materia. Resized and removed border from close window button in Activities overview.
